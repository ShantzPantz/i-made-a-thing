The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.;Mark Twain;death
I love Prince Harry. Good looking and a bit of a rebel. Me and his dad are as thick as thieves and I knew Harry before I knew his dad so we've met a few times. I think he's amazing. And I think you can relate to him because he's made mistakes. He's cool.;Cheryl Cole;amazing
