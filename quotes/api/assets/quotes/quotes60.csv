A newspaper is lumber made malleable. It is ink made into words and pictures. It is conceived, born, grows up and dies of old age in a day.;Jim Bishop;age
I'm actually reading 'World War Z' again! It's incredibly realistic and it's written as an oral history through interviews with different characters.

Sure, I could give advice I could, say, travel the world, listen to music. But all I can really say is do something you want to do and do it well. And if you want to be a choreographer, then you have to make dances.;Mark Morris;travel

In the last fifty years science has advanced more than in the 2,000 previous years and given mankind greater powers over the forces of nature than the ancients ascribed to their gods.;John Boyd Orr;science
A family is a unit composed not only of children but of men, women, an occasional animal, and the common cold.;Ogden Nash;men
Acting is something I love. It's a great craft that I have a lot of respect for. But I don't think it's any greater challenge than teaching 8-year-olds or any other career.

The great strength of the totalitarian state is that it forces those who fear it to imitate it.;Adolf Hitler;strength
You want to put out a TV show? If you have the money to do it on your own, by yourself, and you have a TV network, you can do it by yourself. But the nature of the beast is, art needs finance.

We also maintain - again with perfect truth - that mystery is more than half of beauty, the element of strangeness that stirs the senses through the imagination.;Richard Le Gallienne;beauty

We are built to conquer environment, solve problems, achieve goals, and we find no real satisfaction or happiness in life without obstacles to conquer and goals to achieve.;Maxwell Maltz;happiness
I never said I wanted to be around for a long time. I always said I wanted to be here for a good time.;Kid Rock;time
It's rather splendid to think of all those great men and women who appear to have presented symptoms that allow us to describe them as bipolar. Whether it's Hemingway, Van Gogh... Robert Schumann has been mentioned... Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath... some of them with rather grim ends.;Stephen Fry;women
We had every problems starting a big top could have. The tent fell down on the first day. We had problems getting people into the shows. It was only with the courage and arrogance of youth that we survived.;Guy Laliberte;courage

Be true to the game, because the game will be true to you. If you try to shortcut the game, then the game will shortcut you. If you put forth the effort, good things will be bestowed upon you. That's truly about the game, and in some ways that's about life too.;Michael Jordan;life
The F-word is 'famous,' the C-word is 'celebrity' and S-word is 'star,' in my book. The other three words are fine - you can say those. But 'famous,' 'celebrity' and 'star,' I think, are misused.;Shailene Woodley;famous

When they were done downloading all the information off each hard drive, they took all the computers, all the literature, and loaded everything into a big white truck and left.;Sherman Austin;computers
Also, because people like to multitask, in a way if you've got a bit of music on in the background and the lyrical content is making you want to listen to it, then that would probably put you off the texting you wanted to do.

The success of any great moral enterprise does not depend upon numbers.;William Lloyd Garrison;success
Fables should be taught as fables, myths as myths, and miracles as poetic fantasies. To teach superstitions as truths is a most terrible thing. The child mind accepts and believes them, and only through great pain and perhaps tragedy can he be in after years relieved of them.;Hypatia;great
What we're doing is fun - if you have any sense of humor at all!;Calvin Klein;humor
Religion is the state of being grasped by an ultimate concern, a concern which qualifies all other concerns as preliminary and which itself contains the answer to the question of a meaning of our life.;Paul Tillich;religion
The game of basketball has been everything to me. My place of refuge, place I've always gone where I needed comfort and peace.

The best advice I ever got was that knowledge is power and to keep reading.;David Bailey;knowledge
It's interesting because a lot of my 16-year-old kids' friends know me from 'Wedding Crashers,' and not so much Bond. My kids have a good laugh. I was 20 then.

And it was back in the mid-1980s, and as I point out in a piece, that was when we are spending about eight percent of our gross domestic product on health care. And even then, we had the impression that so much of the excessive, aggressive medical treatment that took place at the end of life was not only unnecessary but it was cruel.;Richard Dooling;medical

John Candy knew he was going to die. He told me on his 40th birthday. He said, well, Maureen, I'm on borrowed time.;Maureen O'Hara;death
One of the amazing things about the Internet is that the content creators are the gatekeepers. We can think of an idea and execute it quickly, and we didn't have to pitch the idea to a major network or convince a studio head to sign-off on the concept.;Ray William Johnson;amazing
I only had a high school education and believe me, I had to cheat to get that.;Sparky Anderson;education

America is the most grandiose experiment the world has seen, but, I am afraid, it is not going to be a success.;Sigmund Freud;success
