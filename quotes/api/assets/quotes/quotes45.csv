Women's humor seems to be a little more supportive. It's just kind of trying to make the other one laugh through funny voices and kind of talking about other people. I respond to that.

In this business you have to develop a thick skin, but I'm always going to feel everything. It's my nature.;Taylor Swift;business

There is little evidence that our individual intelligence has improved through recorded history.;James Lovelock;history
