The aesthetic came along the way, I think - just through experimenting, and going on tour, and trying stuff out on stage, having fun with it, and not taking it too seriously.

I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.

My father was an Episcopalian minister, and I've always been comforted by the power of prayer.;Anna Lee;dad
