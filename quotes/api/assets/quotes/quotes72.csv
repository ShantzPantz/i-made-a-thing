Country music in the mid-'90s was a big influence on my career, and I played all the songs that are referenced in ''94' back in my club days.

I'm very open to dating and finding a guy.;Kristin Cavallari;dating

I say let's go back to a truer use of the word 'freedom.'

The gays like 'Project Runway' because it's a fashion, and the gays are into fashion and into design. It's a creative industry, and most of the gays are pretty creative, in general. That's just like the culture. We're not all into politics necessarily. We're more into the creative environment. I also think Heidi is a big draw. The boys love Heidi and think she's so fabulous. I just think it's a glitzy, fun show, and there are also always lots of gay boys on it, and, you know, that's fun.;Christian Siriano;politics
