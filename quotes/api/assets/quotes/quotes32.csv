I don't like salads: I like the strong food.;Monica Seles;food

I have done many movies that people hadn't seen. 'The Fountain,' I spent a year on that. 'The Prestige' with Chris Nolan, and 'Australia.' From my perspective it's very satisfying.

There is probably a perverse pride in my administration... that we were going to do the right thing, even if short-term it was unpopular.

As a species we are always hungry for new knowledge.;Chaim Potok;knowledge
When I was younger, my coach, Liang Chow, made all the decisions. I would go to the gym for practice, do exactly what Chow told me to do, go home, come back and start all over again. If Chow told me to do 50 squat jumps, I did 50 squat jumps.;Shawn Johnson;home
