We Hoosiers hold to some quaint notions. Some might say we 'cling' to them, though not out of fear or ignorance. We believe in paying our bills.

I spent my whole life in the private sector, 25 years in the private sector. I understand that when government takes more money out of the hands of people, it makes it more difficult for them to buy things. If they can't buy things, the economy doesn't grow.

What the world really needs is more love and less paper work.;Pearl Bailey;work
In grade school I was taught that the United States is a melting pot. People from all over the world come here for freedom and to pursue a better life.

Within our culture, every school has a swimming pool. We lived on the coast. People swam in the surf.

My dad's a beautiful man, but like a lot of Mexican men, or men in general, a lot of men have a problem with the balance of masculinity and femininity - intuition and compassion and tenderness - and get overboard with the macho thing. It took him a while to become more, I would say, conscious, evolved.;Carlos Santana;dad
Don't you see what's at stake here? The ultimate aim of all science to penetrate the unknown. Do you realize we know less about the earth we live on than about the stars and the galaxies of outer space? The greatest mystery is right here, right under our feet.;Walter Reisch;science

We are biological creatures. We are born, we live, we die. There is no transcendent purpose to existence.

Kindness eases everything almost as much as money does.;Mason Cooley;money
I would cap the amount of federal government can spend at 20 percent of the economy. Bring it back to 20 percent or lower. And say, we are not going to spend above that level.
