God is not a dead equation!;Muhammad Iqbal;god
Computers are to design as microwaves are to cooking.;Milton Glaser;computers

Thanksgiving, man. Not a good day to be my pants.;Kevin James;thanksgiving
When I get up and work out, I'm working out just as much for my girls as I am for me, because I want them to see a mother who loves them dearly, who invests in them, but who also invests in herself.

I spent my whole life in the private sector, 25 years in the private sector.
