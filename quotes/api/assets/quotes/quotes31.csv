Girls are taught to sing high and pretty, like Antony, not low and from the guts like Nina Simone. But we're slowly trying to change that.

I love those hockey moms. You know what they say the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is? Lipstick.;Sarah Palin;mom
I think that's what distinguishes Schmidt, really. In the movies now, so much of what is appealing to an audience is the dramatic or has to do with science fiction, and Schmidt is simply human. There's no melodrama there's no device, It's just about a human being.;Jack Nicholson;movies
Success is not in what you have, but who you are.;Bo Bennett;success
We are really on top of one another at the moment and I think it is amazing how we stay so close. Maybe that's the test. Why not totally put yourself together, rather than always wonder whether you actually like each other?;Linda McCartney;amazing
That test should not be about ratings. What should weigh is the knowledge that a public broadcaster delivers programmes that matter.;Jonathan Dimbleby;knowledge
I'm actually tougher on myself as I get older. It's a vicious cycle. The things that are important in life are the things that you can't buy in life: love, health and happiness. I say that, and I believe that, and I try to live that.;Criss Angel;health

The irony is that it was tougher to rent a car from Cerberus when it owned Alamo than to buy a semi-automatic. To rent a car, one had to provide ID, a drivers' license, and get insurance coverage. To buy a gun? Cash and carry, from the back of a station wagon at a gun show. No concerns about downstream liability or risk.;Eliot Spitzer;car
As human beings, we are vulnerable to confusing the unprecedented with the improbable.

Being told about the effects of climate change is an appeal to our reason and to our desire to bring about change.

War puts its questions stupidly, peace mysteriously.;Andre Malraux;peace
I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.

Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.

Half the lies they tell about me aren't true.;Yogi Berra;sports
You hear a lot about God these days: God, the beneficent God, the all-great God, the Almighty God, the most powerful God, the giver of life God, the creator of death.

On a film set everyone is very cool. Well, blase really.;Anthony Daniels;cool
I've never had a very quiet voice. I tried in choir to make it smaller, and it just didn't work out. And I listened to a lot of soul music when I was growing up on my own accord.

Technology is a useful servant but a dangerous master.;Christian Lous Lange;technology

I am endlessly fascinated that playing football is considered a training ground for leadership, but raising children isn't.

Charles Laughton, who's a great hero of mine, only ever made one film and it happens to be one of the great films ever, which is 'The Night of the Hunter.'
