Time is money.;Benjamin Franklin;time
I think one thing that kids who grow up on farms really have going for them is they have exposure to death and birth in a totally different way.

There are a lot of people who consider themselves 'spiritual,' but that can mean a lot of things to a lot of people.

That's kind of sad.;Zachary Levi;sad
I loved almost everything about being a teacher, but I was an unusual teacher.;Dan Simmons;teacher

Bad acting comes in many bags, various odors. It can be performed by cardboard refugees from an Ed Wood movie, reciting their dialogue off an eye chart, or by hopped-up pros looking to punch a hole through the fourth wall from pure ballistic force of personality, like Joe Pesci in a bad mood. I can respect bad acting that owns its own style.;James Wolcott;respect

You know, it shouldn't just be about women as heroic figures overcoming things, it just needs to be about women in general getting the opportunity to play a multitude of roles, telling a multitude of stories - just to express human experience from a woman's perspective.

I've been to therapists my whole life. I find the less attention I pay to food, the healthier I am. Any obsession is dangerous.

It's ridiculous.;Christina Ricci;food
