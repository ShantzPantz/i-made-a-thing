I don't like food that's too carefully arranged it makes me think that the chef is spending too much time arranging and not enough time cooking. If I wanted a picture I'd buy a painting.;Andy Rooney;time

To vilify a great man is the readiest way in which a little man can himself attain greatness.;Edgar Allan Poe;great
Positive rights are the right to shelter, the right to education, the right to health care, the right to a living wage.

In England, it's a rare thing to see a player smoking but, all in all, I prefer that to an alcoholic.

I have such happy memories of performing in a choir and I don't think I'd have got where I am today without all that experience.
