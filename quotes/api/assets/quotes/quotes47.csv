There's this index that tallies up how much your movies have made, and if they haven't grossed a certain amount, then you're not bankable.

Say there's a white kid who lives in a nice home, goes to an all-white school, and is pretty much having everything handed to him on a platter - for him to pick up a rap tape is incredible to me, because what that's saying is that he's living a fantasy life of rebellion.;Eminem;life

When I was young, I had two older sisters, and since I was the youngest in my family, my mom took me around with her all the time.

The time was not yet ripe for the growth of mathematical science among us, and any development that might have taken place in that direction was rudely stopped by the civil war.;Simon Newcomb;science
As a society, I think we express our cultural mores through our politics. We're trying constantly to figure out what's OK and what's not OK. And it's hard, because our society is constantly buffeted by gale force winds of technology. Things are always changing.;Daniel H. Wilson;politics
They are much to be pitied who have not been given a taste for nature early in life.;Jane Austen;nature
Attitudes are more important than facts.;George MacDonald;attitude

Part of what I loved - and love - about being around older people is the tangible sense of history they embody. I'm interested in military history, for instance, because both my grandfathers fought in World War II. I'm interested in writing because one of those grandfathers wrote books.;Jon Meacham;war

I think, in a way, I invented the term 'fight club' and that these things have always existed, but they never really had a label. Nobody had a language to apply to them.
