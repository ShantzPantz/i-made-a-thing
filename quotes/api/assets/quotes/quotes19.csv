It may be that the satisfaction I need depends on my going away, so that when I've gone and come back, I'll find it at home.;Rumi;home
A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days. It is a scaffolding on which a worker can stand and labor with both hands at sections of time.;Annie Dillard;time
Government has the role of suiting people for freedom. People aren't made for freedom spontaneously. There's sort of a 19-year race between when people are born and when they become adults.
