I've been keeping a diary for thirty-three years and write in it every morning. Most of it's just whining, but every so often there'll be something I can use later: a joke, a description, a quote.

But I do not believe that the world would be entirely different if there were more women leaders.

Money is not a motivating factor. Money doesn't thrill me or make me play better because there are benefits to being wealthy. I'm just happy with a ball at my feet.

Your problem is how you are going to spend this one odd and precious life you have been issued.

It makes people relate to him.;James Spader;relationship

You know, fame is a funny thing, man, especially, you know, actors, musicians, rappers, rock singers, it's kind of a lifestyle and it's easy to get caught up in it - you go to bars, you go to clubs, everyone's doing a certain thing... It's tough.;Eminem;funny

A lot of country music is sad.;Willie Nelson;sad
